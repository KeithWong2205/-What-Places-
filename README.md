# MobileAppComplete

#This is a sample project of mine while I was in *Mobile Application* class at my university. 
#This app is basically a rating app that you takes pictures of the meals you have at some places (*Restaurant*, *Coffee Shop*, or *Bar/ Pub*) and add some reviews as well as comment for the many aspects of quality
#The views are very basic, and quite easy to use.
#The app was initially based on the tutorial found at **Apple** for **Swift Programming**, I then expand and implements more of my ideas into the app like *SearchBar Integration*, *Rating Details*, *Different ViewStyle* for my requirement
#The app is supported by iOS 12, can be install on iPhone for testing as well as run on XCode
